# RNAseq_analysis_scripts
Scripts for RNA seq analysis

## cluster.R

This script performs unsupervised analyses from htseq-count outputs. It takes 4 arguments: 

- an input folder with count files generated by htseq-count
- a pattern to identify count files in the input folder
- a count transformation method: either rld, vst, or automatic
- an output directory
- (optional) the number of genes to use for clustering. If none is specified, then the number of determined automatically (see below),

For example, one can type
```bash
Rscript cluster.R input/ count rld output/ 500
```

### Details
The script involves 2 steps
- PCA
- clustering with ConsensusClusterPlus

### Output
- PCA plots with the first 2 PC, with colors corresponding to the clusters from ConsensusClusterPlus
- loadings plot for the first 2 PC
- csv file with the genes with the greatest loadings in the first PC
- a .RData file with results from ConsensusClusterPlus
- two folders with plots from ConsensusClusterPlus: 1 for hierarchical clustering, 1 for k-means clustering
